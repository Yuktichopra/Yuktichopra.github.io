      "abstract": "Working memory capacity varies substantially across individuals, yet the neural mechanisms underlying these differences remain unclear. Using high-density EEG recordings during a visual working memory task, we identified distinct patterns of oscillatory activity that predict individual capacity limits. Our findings reveal that contralateral delay activity (CDA) amplitude scales with memory load up to individual capacity limits, while theta-gamma coupling strength correlates with behavioral performance.",

      "abstract": "Contraction bias—the tendency for memories to shift toward the average of previous stimuli—is a ubiquitous phenomenon in working memory. We present a computational model that explains contraction bias as an optimal strategy for a memory system operating under uncertainty. Using a Bayesian framework, we show how the brain might leverage statistical regularities in the environment to improve memory precision on average, even at the cost of systematic biases.",

We compare symmetric and asymmetric tau (τ) models of evidence accumulation, finding that asymmetric models better account for individual differences in speed-accuracy trade-offs. Our results suggest that people adaptively adjust their decision criteria based on task demands and prior expectations.",
